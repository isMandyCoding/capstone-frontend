## About: 

### What is it? 
Volunteer connect is a platform for volunteers to connect with nonprofits who need them, all while seamlessly tracking their hours for them. 

### Why this app now?

Volunteer Connect came about from a few recent experiences of mine. I’ve been wanting to give back to my community more, and I wanted to build a platform that would make that easier. While I was at an AZ Give Camp hackathon, our nonprofit, Arizonans for Children, was hoping to have a way to track volunteer hours. I realized they couldn’t be the only nonprofit with this need, and the idea for Volunteer Connect was born.

### What did you use?

For my server/database, I used Go to build a RESTful API backed by a PostgreSQL database. On my front end I decided to use Vue because I wanted more experience using a front-end framework other than React. This was my first major project using Go, and while it was challenging to learn while building a full-stack application, I’m glad I chose it because not only did I learn how applicable some programming concepts are across languages, but also new concepts I hadn’t seen before.
